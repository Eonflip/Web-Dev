    <h1>Veggie Stew</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This recipe assumes that you have access to an instant pot, however if you do not a large pot should suffice but cook times may increase.</p>

    <p>This is a recipe for a delicious veggie stew! If you substitute the butter for oil or a non dairy butter it can also be vegan. It should have all the flavor and taste you'd need in a dish</p>
    <p>I like to cook this on a cold night and warm my tummy, its easy and should only take you about 30 minutes total including prepping the ingredients. This recipe can feed 4-6 (depending on your appetite haha
        my partner and I usually eat this for a few meals a week when we're feeling lazy but still want a nutritious meal
    </p>
